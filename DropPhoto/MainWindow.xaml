            In a future update, you will be able to drag and drop your photos into this window. 
            We will copy those files over to local storage in Application Data. 
            You will need to authenticate using your Amazon.com account for this application to work. 
            During the initial development and testing phase, we request you do not use your main Amazon.com account but rather create a separate account that you don't mind bad things happening to. 
            Thank you for your help in testing this application. 
            With your help, we will make a solid, free and open source application to make the most of your Amazon.com Prime account.
